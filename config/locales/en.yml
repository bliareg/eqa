    detail1: 'it’s a gem for revealing  and processing bugs  in your server. Currently there are 3 variants of actions for bug revealing such as.: type in terminal, to write down in a separate document or send http request to the website. We’ll discuss about them in details a bit later.'
    detail10: For example if  tid  is located in curly brackets and not at the start of the line
    detail11: In case this  regexp is written in terminal, we need double screen version.
    detail12: Gem finds out that the request has an error when finds the line which corresponds to regexp of the error
    detail13: For example we need to catch not only  error 500, but also 404
    detail14: To look through values by default you need to type
    detail15: Time in settings by default  is given in seconds
    detail16: Option <strong>--not_modify_timeout</strong>  means time for  thread to finish writing logs in this file, if timeout expires, and during this time file will not be changed at least once, so the file is sent to output, and if there are some errors it will be deleted.
    detail17: Option <strong>--log_file_tracker_waiting</strong> means how often the checking cycle  of temporary files in each thread will take place
    detail18: Option <strong>--debug_mode</strong> provides the data output in stdout about reading from stdin.
    detail19: As it was mentioned above there are 3 ways of  data input
    detail2: To make gem work , there should be  a constant output data flow. You can do this in two ways
    detail20: In stdout is performed by default, if none of the output parameters was indicated
    detail21: In the file if a parameter was indicated
    detail22: For example
    detail23: Into the network. For this you need to indicate a parameter
    detail24: For example
    detail25: http method post is used by default for  data sending, but it can be easily replaced
    detail26: For example
    detail27: Message is a  key by default, under which error is located , so parameter is responsible for this value
    detail28: For example
    detail29: If you need to send some additional parameters with an error so you can set them by means of options such as
    detail3: To lead pipe to gem, e.g
    detail30: Or
    detail31: For example
    detail32: Before sending all errors are encoded in <strong>Base64</strong>
    detail4: This will ensure   stdout  of your program to stdin of gem. The minus of such an approach is that you can apply it only while launching your program which logs you want to track.
    detail5: To show the way to your log file to program,e.g
    detail6: So you can start tracking logs of your program without interrupting its work.
    detail7: To output logs  in a correct way gem needs a unique identification of each request to server .In case the majority of servers are multithreaded and each new request is elaborated in a new flow , so the best suit for this will be thread identificator (tid). To add this unique identifier, e.g in Ruby on Rails framework you need to add only one line
    detail8: After this in each line of output logs  tid is output. It looks like this
    detail9: To find tid gem uses regexp <em>/^\[\d+\]/</em> But if the tid output way differs you can set it
